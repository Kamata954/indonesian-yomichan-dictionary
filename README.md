This dictionary is made to be used with Yomichan. The data was based on the work of Wiktionary.

## Yomichan Setup

If you are already using Yomichan for Japanese/Chinese, I recommend creating a new profile or new browser to load the dictionaries.

You can follow [Xelieu's Mining Setup](https://rentry.co/mining) if this is your first time using Yomichan.

Once Yomichan is set up, go to Yomichan settings > configure installed and enabled dictionaries > import. Import the zip file. (both the json files in the en-id-wiktionary folder should be in a zip file)

Then, go to the Backup section in Yomichan settings and click import. Import the yomichan settings file. If you forget this step words with upper case letters won't be scannable by Yomichan.
