## Yomichan Setup

If you are already using Yomichan for Japanese/Chinese, I recommend creating a new profile or new browser to load the dictionaries.

You can follow [Xelieu's Mining Setup](https://rentry.co/mining) if this is your first time using Yomichan.

Once Yomichan is set up, go to Yomichan settings > configure installed and enabled dictionaries > import. Import the zip file.
